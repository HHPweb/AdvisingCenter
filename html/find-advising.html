	<a href="/cs-hhp/advising/customcf/docs/advising-map-handout.pdf"><img src="/cs-hhp/advising/images/advising-map_1.jpg" alt="map to HHP Advising Center" style="float:left;width:390px"></a>

	<p>Our Advising Center is not located on main campus.  Students will find our building off of Curry Court (which is located off of Charles Blvd across from the ECU Baseball field). It is a one-story, white stucco building that is situated behind the three story brick Carol Belk Building that can be seen from Charles Blvd. Please view the map to the left for more detailed information.</p>

	<p>Students may take the ECU Transit System to the Advising Center.  The 301 <a href="/cs-studentlife/transit/routes_305.cfm">Gold Route</a> circulates around main campus, College Hill and Curry Court (D-Zone parking). It operates out of Mendenhall / West End on a 10 minute frequency Monday through Friday from 7:00am until 6:30pm. The last trip departs Mendenhall / West End at 6:00pm for fall and spring semesters.  See ECU Transit <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/transit">http://www.ecu.edu/transit</a> for additional route information and seasonal hours.</p>
	
	<p>Lots of parking is available around the Advising Center, but students must have a D pass or higher to park without fear of getting a ticket (make sure you read the signs in the lot you park in).  If you do not have a parking permit, there are a few meter spots in front of the Carol Belk Building.</p>
