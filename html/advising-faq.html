					<h4><u>ACADEMIC RULES:</u></h4>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>How many course withdraws were assigned to me when I entered ECU?<a id="a1" name="a1"></a></strong> One course withdraw for every 30 semester hours of classes left to take towards graduation. Course withdraws not used will roll forward to the following term.</li>

Please note that if a student successfully completes a course for which the initial course is a pre-requisite for that they may no longer grade replace the initial course. For example, a student may no longer grade replace ENGL 1100 after successfully completing ENGL 2201.</li>
						<li><strong>How do I take advantage of the grade replacement policy?<a id="a5" name="a5"></a></strong> Any course 3 credits or higher that is repeated will be automatically processed as a grade replacement (nothing has to be done to make that happen). Students simply reregister for the course on Banner.  If a student wishes to use a grade replacement on a course that is 1 or 2 credits they must email their advisor to request a grade replacement be used on the repeated course.</li>
						<li><strong>How long is my ECU catalog valid?<a id="a6" name="a6"></a></strong> 5 years <strong>Where may I get one?</strong> Students may access their undergraduate catalog online. See here for <a href="/cs-acad/registrar/catalog.cfm">access to all online catalogs</a>.</li>

						<li><strong>What are co-requisites?<a id="a8" name="a8"></a></strong> Courses required to be taken <u>with</u> another course (ex. labs). Classes with co-requisites must be added together at the same time on Banner.  The CHEM Dept created a helpful page explaining how to register for courses with co-requisites (it doesn’t just have to be a Science course).  Please follow the directions on this page: <a href="/cs-cas/chem/How-To-Register-FAQs-for-Chemistry-Registration.cfm">http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/chem/How-To-Register-FAQs-for-Chemistry-Registration.cfm</a>. </li>

						<li><strong>Is a student with a cumulative GPA of less than 2.0 considered in academic difficulty?<a id="d2" name="d2"></a></strong> YES!</li>
						<li><strong>What does Academic Difficulty mean?</strong><a id="d3" name="d3"></a> A student will be placed on Academic Warning if he/she does not meet the 2.0 requirement and will remain on Warning until the required GPA is acquired. Depending on the number of GPA hours and transfer hours you have completed, you might be placed on Academic Probation. Two consecutive semesters of Probation will result in Suspension! If you are suspended more than two times you will be suspended indefinitely. Follow the link for more information on <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-hhp/advising/GPA-info.cfm">GPA requirements</a>. Students will receive email notification of Academic Difficulty and will be required to complete an Academic Recovery Module. Students are strongly encouraged to meet with their academic advisor to identify possible strategies which the student will use during the probationary semester to improve academic standing.</li>
						<li><strong>What GPA will I need to declare my major?<a id="d4" name="d4"></a></strong> BS in Exercise Physiology, BS in Athletic Training, and the BS in Public Health Studies (Pre Health Professions concentration) require a 2.75 GPA.

						<li><strong>When is the fitness test given?</strong><a id="d6" name="d6"></a> The test is offered the last Friday of every month during the Fall/Spring semester and at least once over the summer. Register no later than 48 hours in advance and students may access the online sign up system <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-hhp/advising/fit-test-info.cfm">http://www.ecu.edu/cs-hhp/advising/fit-test-info.cfm</a> from the HHP Advising Center's website.</li>
						<li><strong>Who takes the Praxis I and II?</strong><a id="d7" name="d7"></a> Students who are in the Physical Education and School Health (teacher prep) majors. Go to <a href="http://www.ets.org/praxis">www.ets.org/praxis</a> to learn more about the Praxis Exam for educators. The PRAXIS I is required prior to declaration whereas the PRAXIS II is required prior to licensure.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4><u>REGISTRATION:</u></h4>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>What is the registration process?<a id="r1" name="r1"></a></strong> First, you should refer to your major&#39;s planning tools and determine which courses you want to take next. Next, schedule an appointment with your advisor. Your advisor will email you when he/she begins seeing students for advising. It is very important that you schedule your appointment as soon as you get this email to avoid complications registering for courses. At this meeting, you will discuss classes you need to move toward declaring your major and graduation. You will also receive your registration PIN code. Your registration PIN code changes each semester. You should also discuss classes needed to get into certain graduate programs if that is your destination. Follow the link for <a href="/cs-hhp/advising/reg-process.cfm">more information</a> on this process.</li>
						<li><strong>What is the best way to make an appointment to see my advisor?<a id="r2" name="r2"></a></strong> See our <a href="/cs-hhp/advising/advising-appointments.cfm">Appointments page</a> for more information.</li>
						<li><strong>What do I need to bring to the advising meeting that I schedule with my advisor?<a id="r3" name="r3"></a></strong> Bring your major&#39;s planning tools and a list of questions you have for your advisor.</li>
						<li><strong>How may I register?<a id="r4" name="r4"></a></strong> You will register online by using Pirate Port to access Banner. In Banner, you will use your 6-digit registration PIN code to access the drop/add worksheet. Follow the link for <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/banner/">more information.</a>.</li>
						<li><strong>When may I register?<a id="r5" name="r5"></a></strong> The Registrar&#39;s Office provides a <a href="/cs-acad/registrar/RegSched.cfm">schedule</a> that shows what day and time you can register based on how many credits you have earned.</li>
						<li><strong>When do I register for summer classes?</strong><a id="r6" name="r6"></a> You will register for them during the spring pre-registration period at the same time you register for fall classes.</li>
						<li><strong>May I take summer classes at another school and transfer them to ECU?<a id="r7" name="r7"></a></strong> Yes, but under certain guidelines: a) Must have a 2.0 GPA; b) Cannot earn credit for a course you failed at ECU nor grade replace a course at another school; c) Approval will not be granted if the student is ineligible to return to ECU due to disciplinary problems. Students must ask for permission by submitting a <a href="/cs-acad/registrar/forms.cfm">permission form</a> and have the transcripts of the completed course submitted to the Office of the Registrar immediately after completing the course.</li>
						<li><strong>I’m having trouble registering for a class, who do I contact?</strong><a id="r8" name="r8"></a> 
							<ul type="disc">
								<li>First, review our <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-acad/advising/registrationerrors.cfm">common banner errors</a> page as many common registration issues are described and solved.</li>
								<li>If you have difficulty registering for KINE, HLTH, ATEP and RCLS/RCTX courses, contact your advisor through email. Your advisor will NEED TO KNOW the following in order to assist you: your BANNER ID, course name/number/section number, the CRN number of the section you are having difficulty with, and the registration error message you are getting for each course you are having trouble with.</li>
								<li>If you are having difficulty registering for courses other than KINE, HLTH, ATEP and RCLS/RCTX, you must contact those departments for assistance as only they can override and make decisions about their courses. Search for departmental contact information online on ECU&#39;s directory (see left hand menu).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>I have a HOLD on my account, what do I do?</strong><a id="r9" name="r9"></a> 
							<ul type="disc">
								<li>First, view holds in Banner Self Service under your Student Records.</li>
								<li>Next, contact the appropriate department to take care of it. Contact the Advising Center for department contact information if necessary. NOTE that no one, not even your advisor, can make adjustments to your schedule and banner records until all holds have been taken care of and removed from your record.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>What do I do if a class is closed?</strong><a id="r10" name="r10"></a> 
							<ul type="disc">
								<li>NO department will special add students to a closed class during pre-registration! Choose an alternative class. PLEASE NOTE students will be changing their schedules throughout the semester. Keep checking online in Banner to see if something opens.</li>
								<li>Several classes may open at the following times: 
									<ul>
										<li>After grades and standings are processed by the Registrar’s office, students who have been suspended for the following semester will be dropped from their schedule.</li>
										<li>After tuition/fees are due for the upcoming semester, students will unpaid balances left on their accounts will be dropped from their schedule.</li>
										<li>During drop/add (first five days of classes) at the start of the semester. Courses may open after students have attended their first days and gotten a feel for their courses.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>How do I request special permission to be added to a course?</strong><a id="r11" name="r11"></a> 
							<ul type="disc">
								<li>This is ONLY for extreme circumstances when alternative courses are unavailable.</li>
								<li>To obtain special permission, students must email the <u>instructor</u> to inquire about being added. Must include your name, BANNER ID, course name/number/section number, and the CRN number for the section you would like to be added to in your email. If the instructor replies back saying it is okay for you to be added, forward this response to your advisor to be added. NOTE that you may be told to contact the department for this approval (please see above for contact info).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>How do I register for a lab or co-requisite course?</strong> <a id="r12" name="r12"></a> 
							<ul type="disc">
								<li>To register for a lab or co-requisite course, you must register for both courses simultaneously to avoid getting a banner error. There are several ways to do this: 
									<ul>
										<li>In the "Drop/Add Classes Worksheet" enter in the CRN numbers for both courses, then press "submit changes" to register.</li>
										<li>When looking up courses, click "add to worksheet" versus "register" until both CRNs are listed in the "Drop/Add Classes Worksheet." Press "submit changes" to register.</li>
										<li>• When looking up courses under "Add or Drop Classes", select "Advanced Search" and type in the course number partially so that what you have entered is the same for both the course and the lab (example: for CHEM 1150 and 1151, type in 115 for the course number). This will search for both the course and the lab. Register for both courses.</li>
