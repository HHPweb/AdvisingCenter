	<p>
		<a href="http://www.ecu.edu/fsonline/senate/fscalend.cfm">Refer to the Academic Calendar</a> to find out THE LAST DAY TO DO A COURSE WITHDRAW for the current semester. (Please note that your advisorâ€™s email must be submitted to the Registrar's Office by 5PM on the course withdraw deadline date!)
	</p>

	<p>
		If you decide to withdraw from a course you are struggling in using one of your allotted course withdraws, you can NOT do it yourself in Banner.
	</p>

	<ul>FOR ALL ON CAMPUS courses you MUST send an email to your advisor including the following info: 
		<li>Your name</li>
		<li>Banner ID</li>
		<li>Your major</li>
		<li>Course prefix and number (for example: "HLTH 1000")</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Your advisor may ask that you come in to see him/her so make sure to respond appropriately to any follow-up given to your request.
	</p>

	<ul>FOR ALL ONLINE DISTANCE EDUCATION courses you MUST send an email to <a href="mailto:DEdrops@ecu.edu">DEdrops@ecu.edu</a> including the following info:
		<li>Your name</li>
		<li>Banner ID</li>
		<li>Your major</li>
		<li>Course prefix and number (for example: "KINE 1000")</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	MAKE SURE you have a course withdraw left to use - students are limited to sixteen (16) credit hours of withdrawal grades for an undergraduate degree. You can check to see how many course withdraws you have left, but logging onto Banner Self Service &gt; Student tab &gt; Registration &gt; Withdrawal Credits. If you need us to check on this, call the Advising Center at (252) 328-4645. You must know your Banner ID at the time of your call.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>PLEASE NOTE that if you are on <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-hhp/advising/financial-aid-info.cfm">Student Academic Progress (SAP) probation</a> with financial aid, dropping a course may hurt you - it is STRONGLY suggested that you meet with your <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-acad/financial/contactus.cfm">Financial Aid counselor</a> prior to dropping your course.</li>
		<li>If you are DROPPING BELOW FULL-TIME (12 credit hours) you must make sure that you will remain okay with your academic standing/overall GPA goals, Financial Aid, and health insurance coverage.</li>
