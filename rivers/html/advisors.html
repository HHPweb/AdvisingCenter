	<p>The advising staff here in the Rivers Advising Center is prepared to assist students learn to navigate the policies and procedures of the University.   This is accomplished through individual advising sessions, e-mail, group sessions and freshman seminar classes.  The advisor teaches the student to use tools such as the Undergraduate Catalog and the ECU web page to locate information on degree requirements, deadlines, course registration, academic eligibility, calculation of grade point average, procedures for withdrawal, and appeal policies.</p>
	
	<p>Advisors also help students with non-academic issues that impact academic performance.  The advisor is familiar with campus resources and may refer the student for assistance when the situation is beyond the scope of the services provided by the Center.  The Student Advising Center works closely with other ECU Student Services Centers as well as the Registrar's Office, Admissions Office, Financial Aid Office, First Year Center, Dean of Students, Counseling and Student Development Office, Student Health Services, Career Development Center, Continuing Studies, and Cashier's Office to help students find the resources they need to successfully complete their education.</p>
