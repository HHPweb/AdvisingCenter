    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">I received AP credit. How do I get the credit on my record at ECU?</div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">You must request the College Board that administers the tests to send your AP scores to ECU.</div>

    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">All of my transfer credit is not showing up on Banner. What do I do?</div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Make sure that the college or university where you took the courses has sent an official transcript to the ECU Admissions Office.

You know your record better than anyone, so be sure to follow up on the credits that you have earned.<br />
    <br />
    Don&apos;t repeat a course that you already have credit for. You can only receive credit once. Keep your advisor informed and ask for assistance if you are still encountering difficulty.</div>

    <div class="AccordionPanel">
    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How do I know what courses to take each semester?</div>

Your advisor will send you an e-mail when it is time to schedule an advising appointment to plan classes for the next term. Sign up early for an appointment with your advisor to avoid the rush. Come prepared with a list of classes you are ready to take and questions.</div>

    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How many grade replacements do I get?</div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Three prior to fall 2010<br />
Four beginning with classes  repeated fall 2010 or later<br />
Note: Grade replacements  fall 2010 or later will be entered automatically for eligible classes that are  3 credits or more. Grade replacements for 1 and 2 credit classes must be  requested at the Office of the Registrar. (See additional information  below)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="AccordionPanel">
    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How does the grade replacement policy work?</div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">A student is permitted to use the Grade Replacement Policy a  maximum of four times for courses below 3000 in which he or she has earned a  grade of D or F. For example, a student may replace a grade in four different  courses or may replace a single course grade a maximum of four times or a  combination thereof not to exceed the limits of the policy. Approval to use the  policy will not be given if a student wishes to repeat a course after he or she  has successfully completed an advanced course covering the same or similar  material, for example, a course in the same academic discipline for which the  repeated course is a prerequisite.<br />
    <br />
The grade replacements will be automatically processed for courses worth 3 or  more semester hours. The student must request a grade replacement for 1 or 2  semester hour courses by completing a grade replacement form and submitting it  to the Office of the Registrar. The grade replacement form for 1 or 2 semester  hour courses must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the last day of  classes of the semester in which the student retakes the course in order for  the grade replacement(s) to be reflected in the student&apos;s GPA and Academic  Standing for the current semester. Although the original grade will not be used  in determining the GPA of the student, the original grade will remain on the  student&apos;s permanent academic record and will be included in the calculation for  consideration for honors. The replacement grade, or last grade, stands.  Students receiving an F on the replacement grade must repeat the course if  credit is required for graduation. In the event that the original grade was a  D, no additional credit hours will be awarded. The grade replacement policy  does not apply to courses taken prior to fall 1994.</div>

You will earn 6 hours of WI for ENGL 1100 and 1200; you need at least 3 hours of WI in the major and an additional 3 WI hours in any area. Each HHP major is different. Many of the majors have 12 or more hours of WI built into the requirements. <br />
    <br />
    Courses that meet the writing intensive requirement specify &quot;WI&quot; in the course description at the back of the ECU catalog and under &quot;attributes&quot; on Banner.<br />
